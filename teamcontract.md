## Guiding Principles
1. Mutual respect
2. Consider all ideas 
3. Don’t cut each other
4. Show up to meetings in a reasonable amount of time
5. Resolve group conflict with deliberate voting (discuss and vote)

## Purpose
As artists, our main focus is going to be on the artist community aspect of this project. However our ultimate goal is to create a platform that is open and engaging to the general public. 

## Group Roles
The roles for this group will either be rotational or shared. 

Project Manager:

The project manager is expected to lead meetings, keeps big picture in mind, keeps people on task and checks in on progress, and is conscious of success metrics. This role will be rotated for each phase of the project.

Designer:

The designer is in charge of designing assets, mock-ups (lo-fi/hi-fi), and establishing the flow of the project website. This role will be shared between the three of us as a mostly collaborate role. 

User Researcher:

The user researcher is in charge of designing interview questions, finding people to talk to, and understanding / generalizing customer insights. We have decided that user interviews will typically be lead in pairs (a.k.a, two people from the team will interview together each time), but the pairs will swap out, being flexible and concious of everyone's schedules. 

## Division of Labor
We will all rotate the project manager role, and will fill remaining roles together as a team.

## Team Plan
Schedule-sensitive & empathetic. 

## Meeting Management
We plan to meet twice a week for an hour each. We will be clear on what should be done before the meeting. 
Tuesday 8-9PM
Saturday 2-3PM

## Accountability
In general we will report to project manager when a task is done. If there has been no contact between a teammate and the current project manager, the project manager will reach out to check up on progress. Also report to manager if a task cannot be done on time/there’s a problem.

## Rewards & Punishments
Reward = Asian food!
No punishment. We all self-punish already.

## Follow-up
Revise anytime we want.
