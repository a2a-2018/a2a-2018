### The Prototype

The following is an overview of our high fidelity prototype:

![Fig. 1: High Fidelity Prototype Overview](/img/Overview.png)

**Task 1: Event Discovery and Notification**

A user browses their feed, which is populated with artwork, discussions, and events related to interests that they list upon first login (and which they can modify under settings), as well as to groups that they follow.

![Fig. 2.1: A populated feed|small](/img/Feed-Main.png)

When a user sees an event for which they'd like to be notified, they press the star icon.

When the time comes, a2a notifies them of the upcoming event. When the user opens the app, they are brought to the notifications page.

If they touch the thumbnail for the event, they can view the event page for more details.
