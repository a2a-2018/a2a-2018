### The Prototype

Our InVision prototype can be found [here](http://invis.io/NGGTUYQV3FW). The following is an overview of our high fidelity prototype:

**Task 1: Event Discovery and Notification**

A user browses their feed, which is populated with artwork, discussions, and events related to interests that they list upon first login (and which they can modify under settings), as well as to groups that they follow.

When a user sees an event for which they'd like to be notified, they press the star icon.

When the time comes, a2a notifies them of the upcoming event. When the user opens the app, they are brought to the notifications page.

If they touch the thumbnail for the event, they can view the event page for more details.

**Task 2: Art Showcasing**

When a user would like to upload an image, they touch the "plus" icon, which will bring them to the following page:

Pressing the peach-colored "choose file" button calls a menu which allows them to decide from where they'd like to take the art file to upload.

The app will communicate with the selected source, allowing the user to view their files and select one.

The user may also input additional information, such as a title for their work, a description, and some tags to help users find the piece via search bar. Upon satisfaction, the user presses the upload button and their work is shared with the community.

### Implementation Decisions / Design Changes

### Feed Post Buttons ###
Some usability test participants commented that they could not recognize the Follow button on a post, confusing it with a Seen icon indicating view counts. We reworked our Follow button to a Star button for clarity, and also added a real Seen icon to let users know how well posts reach other users. We also recolor all interact-able buttons to peach (the app's accent color), and other icons grey.

### Upload Text Fields ###
We change the appearance of all text fields in the upload page from text boxes to borderless fields, indicated by simple lines under the texts. This helps preserve consistency with other parts of the app, such as the onboarding text fields.
