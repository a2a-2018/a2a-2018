**DESIGN & TASKS**

From our initial design concepts, we elect to choose the hybrid design that consists of a website and native mobile app. The two tasks that we choose are event discovery/notification and artwork showcase. Both media will share the same content and support both tasks. At the same time, the native app would be slightly skewed towards event discovery, providing in addition a platform for users to learn about new events, check in to events, and interact with other users/performers at the same events.

Our contextual inquiry findings stress the importance of the two tasks chosen. Artists and non-artists alike lament the lack of a streamlined, centralized source to discover new local events and arts. Events tend to pop up on a variety of different outlets (Facebook, Daily Messages, words of mouth), and users have to sort through non-events or events they are not interested in. Moreover, artists - both individuals and groups - often showcase their works as well as connect with audience and fellow artists via a range of disparate platforms. Thus, there is a lack of synchronicity between content advertisement from artists and content discovery by non-artists and artists. Solving the two tasks would bridge this gap, creating the perfect foundation to build a local art community.

Using both web and mobile app formats provides users with the advantages of both media. For artwork showcase, a website - often accessed on a computer - enables users to more comfortably set up their own posts and browse posts from other people: the real estate of a computer screen provides more information during post navigation, and keyboard & mouse potentially serve a more flexible range of inputs, compared to a touch screen. Meanwhile, since phones are more portable and people carry them everywhere, the mobile app supports more on-the-go operations, such as checking in to an event and interacting with other event-goers as well as artists/performers. Considering how our aim is to foster a community, optimizing user-to-user interaction is key, and we achieve this by tailoring our app to the different web and mobile media.
