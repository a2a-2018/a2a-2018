While we still have some meetings scheduled past the due date of this assignment, the data that we’ve gathered so far reveals a few main themes.  The two biggests concepts pertinent to the project design are that artists want to be able to communicate easily with people outside their social circles, and that in general, people are interested in a centralized platform to discover art-related events on campus. Another big find that we have discovered is that it is quite difficult to conduct contextual inquiries to find out user needs from a community that we want to build, but does not yet exist yet. 

### Contextual Inquiry Participants
As of February 27, we have done five interviews with contextual inquiry components, but still have two other interviews and a contextual inquiry of two dancers beginning a collaboration scheduled for after this portion of the project is due.  Our participants were both artists and non-artists who are interested in the arts.  After our first meeting, which ended up being more of an interview than a contextual inquiry, we modified our format to emphasize our participants walking us through the physical process of how they have connected with artists to collaborate or discovered art-related events, and made sure to ask them many questions, such as what about certain events caught their eye or interest, or what about some information source they were using particularly caught their interest.  

**KS** is a student interested in art, but do not participate in creating works. We started off asking them a few interview questions, which revealed that they mainly use Facebook and Social Calendar to learn about nearby arts events/performances. They then proceeded to walk us through how they parse through information on their phone: On Facebook, KS looked for events that their friends are also going to, as they are less likely to go to an event alone. KS also noted that Social Calendar works because they don’t like to have a lot of apps on their phone, so a centralized, streamlined non-app format is great. KS really wants to know more about art events and club opportunities out there, but would not go out of their way to search for them, due to limited time.

**JC** is a current Studio Art major. We conducted the interview in the OIT section of Sawyer library because it is a primary location that JS likes to produce art in (OIT is the only place on campus that has tablets to do digital art on). Their preferred mediums are traditional pencil / charcoal drawings, digital art, and graphic design. They proceeded to walk us through how they showcase their art currently. They use a personal website to showcase their art, so they walked us through uploading a new piece onto the website. They talked about how having a personal website is nice, but discovering their website is hard. They said it would be great if there were some kind of central platform to showcase art. We had them retroactively walk us through their collab process with another art studio student. The piece they created was for class, but only optionally collaborative. JC showed us the platforms they used to establish the collab - Facebook Messenger and Google Docs. JC also described that this process was very flexible, and each artist could go at their own pace. During the contextual interview, JC also revealed that being an artist and the creative process at Williams can be very lonely and would love to see a more connected creative community to critique, discuss, and collaborate with. 

**KY** is a student actively dancing with the Asian Dance Troupe. They do a lot of creative writing on the side as well as making memes. 

**WC** is a student interested in art, but does not create. We interviewed WC in Sawyer Library because this is where they does most of their work, but also slacks off from their work. WC enjoys interacting with different forms of art during these times of slacking off. We had WC show us their process of interacting with art: reading manga, watching anime, and watching creative videos on YouTube. It is important to note that none of this art is local-created art. We asked WC to show us their process of art discovery, and they showed us a couple forums that they like to follow, and also explained that a lot of discovery happens through word of mouth for them. They expressed interested in interacting with a local creative community, but did not really know what that would entail besides the potential of knowing about more events on campus. 

**DP** works at Williams as the Spencer Studio Art assistant and also a local artist whose main practice is in oil and acrylic painting. DP’s is an interesting blend between our user cases because they are a local artist that interacts with the out of Williams’ community but also interact with students and professors daily while they do their job for the Studio Art department (they are involved with ordering materials for students). We interviewed DP in their office in the studio building, right across from the paint studio. We chose this location because this is where DP interacts with most studio students, as he has informal office hours for material information and ordering. DP’s door and office hours were open while we conducted the contextual inquiry, but it was not a very busy day for them. While we waited, we had DP retroactively walk through their process of showcasing their art: also through a personal website. We watched DP upload a faux image to show how they keep their website updated. Towards the end we ended up chatting about the current ‘creative’ community at Williams. In DP’s mind, the creative community exists as much in Williamstown as it does in North Adams. Apparently, a lot of artists move from New York City because the cost of living is too high, and prefer to create art here instead - Mass MoCa being the main attraction. DP talked a lot about the hierarchy and exclusiveness of difference circles within the community, the hierarchy created from job prestige on campus (Williams Professor vs. Assistant). DP also mentioned that they are very intrigued by student’s work in that their ideas are expansive, unhindered, and innovative. DP is also a large advocate of cross-generational collaborative art. 

### Contextual inquiry themes & process
Identify high level themes the participants share in their practices from an affinity diagram.
Artists want a way to easily reach out to acquaintances/people they don’t know directly and have discussions, request critiques, and view collaboration opportunities
Art can feel pretty solitary (this came from a poet and a graphic designer)
Streamlined format of delivery (less app, more like Facebook posts, Daily Messages, etc) What do these preferred forms of communication reveal about the users? (what do faster horses reveal to Henry Ford?) -> They want some centralized/intuitive workflow for how they navigate the art community
Everybody has to resort to using multiple independent and often inconsistent sources of information to find events and job opportunities
Not a clear distinction between artists and non-artists: self-proclaimed non-artists might have artistic background in some unrelated way (WC plays cello); artists chiefly needs to consume/critique art in their process of producing art -> maybe don’t differentiate different types of profile pages? A singular type of profile page?
Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest important tasks to design for?
A way to find events all in one place
Discussion platform
A way to showcase art
A way to discover other artists
Describe your process for identifying these themes.
Affinity diagramming helps consolidate input data into themes.

### Task analysis questions

1. Who is going to use the design?

   At the moment, mainly students who are involved in or interested in the arts in any capacity, but this could easily be expanded to non-student, local artists and potential employers.

2. What tasks do they now perform?

⋅⋅⋅Artist-students create art on campus, mostly for class, few are motivated to create outside of academics because of shortage of time. Local artists also create art on campus and share their creations within their own friend circles, but not much outside of that. Both do collaborations, but mostly with people that they already know and are friendly with. Students that are interested in art but do not create vaguely enjoy art on campus when they hear about an event and are interested in it. Potential employers… look for artists to employ (with much trouble).

3. What tasks are desired?

⋅⋅⋅Discover art, discover artists, communicate with artists, collaborate with artists, critique artwork, discuss ideas, contact artists for hire. 


4. How are the tasks learned?

⋅⋅⋅The tasks are learned through discovering needs driven by creative incentive (discovery, communication, collaboration, critiquing, etc.). 

5. Where are the tasks performed?

⋅⋅⋅Most of these tasks are rarely performed, but over messaging/e-mail, in shared spaces such as Spencer Art building, and over the web. 

6. What is the relationship between the person and data?

⋅⋅⋅They either use data to discover, experience, or reach out / communicate. 

7. What other tools does the person have?

⋅⋅⋅Daily messages, E-mail, Word of Mouth, social circles. 

8. How do people communicate with each other?

⋅⋅⋅Facebook Messenger and E-mail

9. How often are the tasks performed?

⋅⋅⋅Whenever they need to????

10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?

⋅⋅⋅Other classes and responsibilities at Williams????

11. What happens when things go wrong?

⋅⋅⋅I DON’T KNOW OKAY
