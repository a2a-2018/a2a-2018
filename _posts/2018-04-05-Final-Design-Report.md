***Problem and Solution Overview***

The Williams College campus has the potential to host a very vibrant creative community.  However, there is currently no structures to facilitate this.  Art in any form - visual, vocal, musical, written, etc. - has always been a very separate part of campus.  Additionally, different fields of art are very disparate and disconnected.  That is to say, visual art stays in the Spencer Art Studio, within the Art Department and museums, music stays in Chapin Hall, Brooks-Rogers, and other music buildings, and so on.  Our goal is to design a platform that accomplishes two things. The first is to allow local artists (students, faculty, local residents, etc.) to showcase their art, interact with viewers and artists, and find a space for collaboration.  The second is to facilitate interaction between community members who do not create art themselves and the arts by giving them a centralized way to discover art, interact with artists, and find information on local events and shows.

***Design Research Goals, Stakeholders, and Participants***

In our design research, we conducted seven contextual inquiries with student artists, students interested in art, and a faculty artist.  Our inquiries often had a retrospective flavor, since very few artists are in collaboration right now due to time constraints and difficulty initiating such work in the current state of things.

Of the seven people we talked to, five were artists.  **DM** is a student dancer, actor, and musician who works in both the ‘62 Center and the music facilities separately.  They emphasized a desire for a way to easily initiate collaboration between the two areas.  **DP** is a faculty artist who spends most of their time working with students in Spencer Art Studio.  They expressed interest in being able to showcase art on equal footing with students and professors alike.  **JC** is a Studio Art major who focuses on both traditional art and graphic design.  They walked us through their collaboration and showcase processes, showing us the methods they use to get around the current lack of centralized platform.  **JT** is a student dancer who has also worked on multimedia collaborations before coming to Williams.  They used materials they had from their previous collaborations to demonstrate for us their process, and commented on the Williams art community’s need for a way to communicate across media, and not just for collaboration.  **KY** is Computer Science major who is both a writer and a choreographer for the Asian Dance Troupe.  They explained how the only way they were able to initiate their current collaboration was through club connections, and that if they had not had some contact with their partner, the work probably would not have happened.

Our two other inquiries were with two students who do not produce art themselves, but are interested in the arts.  **KS** emphasized the need for a centralized and streamlined way to find information about events, as well as which ones their friends were also interested in.  **WC** is an Economics major who is particularly interested in foreign comics and cartoons.  They strongly supported bringing the art communities on campus together, for the sake of both the artists and the wider community.
