Our paper prototype supports our two main tasks, art showcase/discovery and event discovery/notification, along with a few minor tasks like logging in and changing settings.

**Task 1: Event Discovery and Notification**

The user finds an event that interests them.

They touch the "follow" icon to tell a2a that they'd like to be reminded about the event when it draws near.

When it's time, the user receives a notification about the event.

They open the notification on their phone...

And a2a opens.

They can touch the "notifications" icon to see their unread items.

They can also touch the notification about the event...

...and this will bring them to the notification message which gives details about the event.
