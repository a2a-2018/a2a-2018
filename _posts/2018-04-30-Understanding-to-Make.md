**Problem and Solution Overview**

Art often has difficulty making its own space in the Williams community.  Artists typically only work within their own medium, be it visual art, music, or dance, and community members who enjoy art do not currently have a single, centralized place to find out what events and works are being hosted by the different art communities.  Hence, we designed a2a, a platform for local artists, both students and not, to share their works and host events, and for those who enjoy art to keep up-to-date with what is new in the Williams art community.  The current version of a2a, while supporting some minor necessary workflows such as logging in and managing settings, focuses especially on the tasks of discovering future events and setting notifications for them, and uploading art to showcase for the community.
