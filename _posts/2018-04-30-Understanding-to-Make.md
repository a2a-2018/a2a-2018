# a2a: artist2artist, art2all

**Roles**

Quan Do - designer, master of the high-fidelity prototype
Grace Mazzarella - designer, documenter, master of the paper prototype
Dawn Wu - designer, founder, master of the high-fidelity and video prototype

**Problem and Solution Overview**

Art often has difficulty making its own space in the Williams community.  Artists typically only work within their own medium, be it visual art, music, or dance, and community members who enjoy art do not currently have a single, centralized place to find out what events and works are being hosted by the different art communities.  Hence, we designed a2a, a platform for local artists, both students and not, to share their works and host events, and for those who enjoy art to keep up-to-date with what is new in the Williams art community.  The current version of a2a, while supporting some minor necessary workflows such as logging in and managing settings, focuses especially on the tasks of discovering future events and setting notifications for them, and uploading art to showcase for the community.

**Appendix**

*Original Task Instructions*

Onboarding: “You’ve heard of this new app called a2a which gives the Williams community a centralized platform for artwork and art-related event sharing. You’ve just downloaded the app. Please create a new account. Don't forget to tell me what you're thinking.”

Upload an artwork: “Now that you have an account, you’ve decided that your portfolio looks a little empty. Please upload an artwork. Don't forget to tell me what you're thinking.”

Set an event notification: “You’re looking for something to do over the weekend. Please choose an event and set a notification for it. Don't forget to tell me what you're thinking.”

*Revised Task Instructions*

Onboarding: [no change]

Upload an artwork: “Now that you have an account, you’ve decided that your portfolio looks a little empty. Luckily, you’ve just done an in-class portrait assignment in Drawing 100 that you’re proud of, and so you take a photo of it, crop it, and upload it to Drive. Now it’s time to add your portrait in green to your a2a portfolio. Don't forget to tell me what you're thinking.”

Set an event notification: “You’re looking for something to do over the weekend. One of your friends reminds you that their show, ‘Fancy Dance’, is happening. However, you know you’ll never remember when and where it is. You remember that a2a has an event notification feature, so you decide to set a reminder for the ‘Fancy Dance’. Don't forget to tell me what you're thinking.”
