### Usability Tests

**User Test 1**

KY is an undergraduate student at Williams studying Computer Science. KY represents our typical user, a student at a rural, small college who produces art in their spare time, and constantly seeks out new arts and artists in the vicinity. We conducted the test in Jesup, one of the prime study spots on campus (students work on works and look through phone to explore).

For the test, we provided some background on our project and explained that we want him to complete a task on the interface, thinking out loud in the process. We described each task we wanted KY to do before letting him use the application and did not answer questions or provide help as he was performing the tasks. Quan was the computer, Grace was the observer, and both were the facilitator.

From this interview, there were a couple of workflows in our app that trapped a user on screens (lacking back buttons in our paper prototypes), so we quickly added those in for the second and third user interviews. We also had some issues with our tasks not being specific enough, which caused KY to stray from the path we intended they’d take, and so we revised our tasks to be more specific for the next two tests.

**User Test 2**

LL is an undergraduate student at Williams. LL represents our typical user, a student at a rural, small college who does art, actively participates in collaborations and wants to find other artists on campus. We conducted the test in Mission, a typical study spot for LL.

For this test, we provided background information on the app, presented a scenario and had LL fulfill our two revised tasks given the scenario. We described each task we wanted LL to do, prompting them to think aloud before letting them use the application and did not answer questions or provide help as they was performing the tasks. Grace was the computer, Dawn was the observer, and both were facilitators.

From this interview, both tasks were easily accomplished with the new back buttons and the more concrete sense of direction, so LL did not have any pressing issues. There was some confusion about button placement on the feed, but we did not immediately change this feature for the next tester, as the time between before our next test was too short to change all of the paper prototypes. 

**User Test 3**

SM is an undergraduate student at Williams. SM represents an atypical user, as they appreciate and produce art, but have never really been invested in the local art community here. We conducted the test in Sawyer Library, a favored work and study spot for SM. 

For the test, we provided the usual background information on the app, presented our scenario and had SM fulfill our two tasks based on this. We described each task we wanted SM to do, prompting them to think aloud before letting them use the application, and did not answer questions or provide help as they were performing the tasks. Grace was the computer, Dawn was the observer, and both were facilitators.

As with LL, both tasks were easily accomplished with the new back buttons and concrete sense of direction guiding the tasks, so SM did not have any pressing issues. There was still some confusion about button placement and overall app functionality, as the user was not aware of capabilities of the app.

### Results

**Incident**

User discovered an inability to edit user profile because no button / workflow for it existed. 

*Severity*: Low

*Explanation*
This was an oversight on our part, and so we added the ability to edit user profile workflow under the settings tab. 

**Incident**

User was not able to see portfolio before they had added anything.

*Severity*: Low

*Explanation*
We didn’t think to create this page when we originally made our paper prototypes. This was easily fixed by quickly creating the empty portfolio page for future user tests.

**Incident**

User was wary of individual ability to post events, as they do not want to be spammed with “fake” or “joke” events. User wants to restrict ability to post events to just groups, which brings up the concept of having group profiles.

*Severity*: Medium

*Explanation*
Although the fear of having fake or joke events created by individuals is legitimate, we still want to be able to provide the ability to create events for individuals for the cases of individual shows, solo showcases, recitals, etc. However, it is a good concept to have the ability to create groups in a2a, so we have added that workflow into a2a.

**Incident**

User was confused during the profile overview portion of the onboarding process - they thought they had to re-enter all the information.

*Severity*: Medium

*Explanation*
The review screen which gives an overview of the user’s profile as they’ve formed it has the vague profile “Basic Profile”, and the “finish” button doesn’t stand out as much as it should, which is probably what led to this confusion. To help resolve these issues, we renamed the “Basic Profile” screen to something like “Review Information” or “Review Profile”. We also changed the color of the “finish” button from black to peach to make it stand out more.
