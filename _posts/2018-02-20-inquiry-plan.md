The main group we anticipate using a2a is Williams College’s student artists across all media.
Other groups include potential employers, local community members, and other students who are interested in the arts but do not participate in creating it.
Each of us is involved in or know people in different areas of the arts, and our social circles generally don’t intersect, so we can arrange the interviews with ease and have it so that we don’t speak with people we know.
For example, if someone knows a dancer who’s willing to interview, they can set up a meeting between them and an interviewer who doesn’t know them.
