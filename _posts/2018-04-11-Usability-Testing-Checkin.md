**HEURISTIC EVALUATION**

We conducted 2 heuristic evaluations. For each of the heuristic violation uncovered, we assigned a severity rating and revised the design to satisfy the heuristic.

**1. Inconsistency of Notification Tab**

Problem: The notification tab opens up  a dialog box instead of a full page like the other sections. Users are confused about whether they should navigate this section in a different way compared to other sections that they have seen. Moreover, the inbox and notification sub-sections are squeezed together into one screenful, presenting users with a very crowded interface.

Heuristics Violated: Consistency and Standards. Minimalist Design.

Severity Rating: 2

Revision:

We reworked the notification section into a full page, similar to other tabbed sections. We also renamed the "Recent" sub-section to "Notifications" and "Inbox" to "Messages" to avoid confusion. Only one of the sub-sections is displayed at a time, and users can switch between using a handy tab at the top of the page.

**2. Inconsistency in Upload Workflow**




**3. Inconsistency in Back Button Placements**

Problem: For most of our design, the "Back" button of each screen is placed at the upper left corner of the interface. However, for some sections, the button has been placed at the end of a field to be filled in, requiring users to spend extra time locating the simple, commonly used feature.

Heuristic Violated: Consistency and Standards.

Severity Rating: 1

Revision:

![Figure 5: Inconsistency in Back Button Redone](/img/Edit1b.JPG)

We relocated the "Back" button to the upper left corner, standardizing all parts of the interface.
