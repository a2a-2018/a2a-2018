**HEURISTIC EVALUATION**

We conducted 2 heuristic evaluations. For each of the heuristic violation uncovered, we assigned a severity rating and revised the design to satisfy the heuristic.

**1. Inconsistency of Notification Tab**

Problem: The notification tab opens up  a dialog box instead of a full page like the other sections. Moreover, the inbox and notification sub-sections are squeezed together into one screenful of information.

Heuristic Violated: Consistency and Standards.

Severity Rating: 2

Revision:

We reworked the notification section into a full page, similar to other tabbed sections. We also renamed the "Recent" sub-section to "Notifications" and "Inbox" to "Messages" to avoid confusion. Only one of the sub-sections is displayed at a time, and users can switch between using a handy tab at the top of the page.
