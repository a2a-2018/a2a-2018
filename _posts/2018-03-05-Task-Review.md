**Advertise the need/desire to collaborate and/or search for collaboration opportunities** (new task, easy/medium)

Mai is a student dancer developing a piece for her choreography tutorial.  This process includes costuming, but she doesn’t know how to draw and isn’t even interested in designing.  She’s asked her friends if they know anyone interested in costume design, and they suggest talking to the Art department, studio art majors, and the costume shop.  However, Mai doesn’t know any of these people, and neither do her friends.  She can email some professors and the shop managers to see if they can point her in a direction, but she knows that even if they give her recommendations, there’s no guarantee that these people would be interested in working with her.

**Browse/discover events and set notifications** (existing task, medium/hard)

Mark is a Physics major who enjoys relaxing after a long week by listening to acapella.  He keeps a close eye on Daily Messages, the Social Calendar, and the different Facebook pages, watching for event notices to pop up.  When he happens upon them, he sets a reminder on Google Calendar so that he doesn’t forget to attend, even if he gets caught up working on his thesis.  This system works for him so long as he has the time to check all three sources, since not all of them have the same information.  If he doesn’t have time to read the Social Calendar or spend on Facebook checking the acapella group pages, if the group forgets to advertise their show on Daily Messages, there’s a chance he might miss a show.
